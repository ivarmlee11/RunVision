# Run Vision

## Notes

* Clone this repo
* Navigate to the root folder
* Get a Google Maps API Key and change the key in public/js/app.js
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Open with Foreman and Nodemon 

## Explanation

* API List
* Google Maps JavaScript
* Google Snap to Roads
* Google Static Street View Image

* My plan was to make an app where you could share runs in the form of a Google Street View slideshow.
* The main problem I have with my app is that I wasn't able to get Google Snap To Roads to be more accurate.
* I will rebuild it and use Google Directions to get my lat long points. Using Google Directions would have provided better map drawing functionality.
* This code has poor organization, that will need to be addressed in the next version.
